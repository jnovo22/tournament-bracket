# tournament-bracket
A Pen created at CodePen.io. Creating a tournament bracket, complete with the lines, with the Flexbox. That means no tables, no absolute positioning, no images or svg, just plain ole html and css.

Forked from [Aron Duby](http://codepen.io/aronduby/)'s Pen [Tournament Bracket with Flexbox](http://codepen.io/aronduby/pen/qliuj/).
